One mother cell produces two daughter cells, which are exact copies of the mother cell. The phases of mitosis are shown below:

During [[prophase]], the [[chromosomes]] are copied/doubled and [[spindle fibres]] begin to form. 

During [[metaphase]], the spindle fibres (which are attached to the [[chromosomes]]) draw the chromosomes to the equater of the cell. 

During [[anaphase]], the fibres pull on the chromosomes, splitting them in half at two ends of the cell. 

during [[Telophase]] and [[cytokinesis]], the cell constricts about the equater and begins to split in half.

The cells produced during mitosis are called [[somatic cells]], in contrast with the [[gametes]] formed during meiosis.
