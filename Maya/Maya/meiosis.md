One mother cell goes through a process similar to mitosis twice. During this process, the [[crossing over]] occurs, which leads to greater genetic diversity:

Meiosis is used to produce [[gametes]] such as [[sperm]] and [[ova]]. The granddaughter cells have half the number of chromosomes as the mother cell. 

The phases of meiosis are given below:

[[Crossing over]] occurs during the first stage of meiosis, resulting in four unique granddaughter cells.
