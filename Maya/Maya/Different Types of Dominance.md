Mendelian Dominance - Heterozygous [[genotype]] leads to the dominant trait being full expressed and the recessive trait being fully repressed. Example: Blue eyes vs brown eyes. Bb => Brown eyes


Codominance - BOTH traits are expressed in the heterozygous case. Half the petals are one color, half the other.


Partial Dominance - NEITHER trait is fully expressed but instead mix, you get pink petals
