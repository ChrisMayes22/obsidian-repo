Punctuation that is used to separate a [[complete sentence]] and a phrase or clause that gives a definition or example or explanation of something in that previous sentence.


EXAMPLES:
	"The dog went outside for one reason: It wanted to use the restroom."
	"Mother bought three things: eggs, potatoes, and butter."
	"Madeleine recognized the problem: disconnected pipes. "
	"Geology mainly focuses on soft minerals: oil production, gravel, and cement are topics in this study."


EXAMPLE TRAPS:
	"The dog went outside: she was very stinky." -- Clauses are not directly related by example, definition, or explanation.
	"Mother bought: Eggs, potatoes, and butter." -- First clause is not a complete idea (we are missing an object for bought)
