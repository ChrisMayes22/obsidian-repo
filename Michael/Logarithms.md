**CONVERT FROM LOG FORM TO EXPONENTIAL FORM:**

log_b(x) = y 

The point of this operation is to find an inverse exponential function relative to the log above. That function would be...

b^y = x

****

**LOG RULES:**
QUOTIENT: log(x/y) = log(x) - log(y)

PRODUCT: log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)

POWER: log(x^y) = y * log(x)
