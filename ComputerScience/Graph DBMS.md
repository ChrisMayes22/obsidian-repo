Graph DBs are the most specialized of the NoSQL solutions and work specifically with problems where the adjacency of entities is important--in other words, in situations where it is important to implement efficient pathing algorithms. For example, a graph DB might be used to model distances between cities. 

Graphs store records in nodes/vertices and relationships between the records as edges.
