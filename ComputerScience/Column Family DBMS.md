A (typically) [[schema-less]] family of NoSQL DBMS that implement columns, column families, and [[rows]] as a way of persisting data. They are superficially similar to RDBMS, except [[rows]] might differ significantly from each other. This lack of consistent structure makes the NoSQL solution more flexible and extendable in some ways but also limits the power of the [[query language]], since there can be no JOIN operators that assume rigid tabular structure.
