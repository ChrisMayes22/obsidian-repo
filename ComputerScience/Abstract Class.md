An abstract class acts as a template for subclasses by providing unimplemented [[methods]]. For example, a shape class might expose a getArea method that each individual shape class is expected (perhaps as part of one of its [[contracts]]) to individually implement.

Note that Abstract Classes implement/enforce a contract.

Unlike [[Interfaces]], Abstract classes can provide [[concrete methods]].  Because of this, abstract classes are sometimes called [[implementation inheritance]].
