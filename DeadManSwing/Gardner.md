Gardner is the pseudonym for a Nosferatu a little older than [[Madeleine Citronelle]]. He lives alone in a arboretum domain, which he tends by himself. 

With bark-like skin, he blends in with the tree bark and can be hard to find at night; some [[he may have a surveillance system]].

There is a [[large, dead tree in the arboretum]], and he made a point of illustrating to Madeleine that the tree's previous owner had done a poor job of caring for the plant.

Madeleine trades rare plants from [[Dave]] in exchange for information. On one occasion, Madeleine exchanged a [[firedrop buttercup]] for a [[list of the invitees to the Claymore Party]].

Madeleine owes him a petty bane from her [[banelist]] because he insulted her intelligence.
