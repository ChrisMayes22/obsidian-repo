Madeleine is a twelfth generation Malkavian neonate whose narcissism is both her savior and her fatal flaw. Through [[Keeper]], [[Grandiose]], and [[Brittle]], she stays in touch with a version of humanity Ã©namoured with itself. 

Each facet of Madeleine's personality depends on a Touchstone: [[Dr. Diane Batson]] for Keeper, [[Angie Hitch]] for Brittle, and [[Rick Page]] for Grandiose. 

In these nights, Madeleine thirsts for recognition within the ranks of the [[Stermont]] [[Camarilla]]--as a testament to her abilities and as a tool by which to claw for more power and protection.

Among mortals, Madeleine has a single jewel, and the jewel's name is [[Dave]]. Through him, she can wield powerful influence among mortals.

Madeleine's relationships to the Kindred are more varied and mixed. Her sire [[Mother Franklin]] met her end through the neonate's wrath; her true caretaker now is [[Denice]], and sometimes she can find aid rom [[Gardner]]. [[Sierra]] counts herself as Madeleine's enemy.

She currently lives with [[Miss Muffete]] and previously was in a coterie with [[Doma]] and [[Tooth]]
