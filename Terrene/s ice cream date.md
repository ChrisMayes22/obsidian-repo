[[Quelani]] and [[Shimmerlace]] set out with the goal of acquiring some diamonds so that Quelani can cast revivify, except Shimmer immediately veers the pair into an ice cream date.

The pair meet [[Ornelia]], insult her ice cream, and drug her (all in fun). The drugs hit Ornelia hard, but the pair convince her to go home to her husband while they take care of her shop. 

As they work, met [[Farnesworth]] enters the shop and orders cherry ice cream. They discuss their pasts, and then Barnesworth makes the pair aware of the [[DeWatt Private Postal Service]]. 

After Shimmerlace and Quelani finish up at the ice cream store, they wander the town in comfy exploration and talk about their pass, hopes, and goals. 

Quelani discusses her failure as the [[queen of Izalith]], cites her [[Seath changes]], discusses her failure as [[the Corvignan apprentice]], Recounts her [[failed flirting with Kiron]], her dreams of one day becoming [[teacher Quelani]], and her conviction that she's sure to suffer a deserved death.

Shimmerlace attempts (successfully for the most part) to comfort Quelani. In the process, she discusses [[past Teacher Quelani]], her success as an ice cream server, the importance of [[shitty mortals]], the fact that family extends beyond parents, and surprises Quelani with the news that she has now experienced a date. As part of this, she discusses her own [[Shimmerlace's Children]], and cites her poor relationship with [[Hollyberry]] in particular. 

At the end, the two agreed their mutual goal is to help combat [[Corvigna]] in the oncoming refugee crisis, find the DeWatt Postal Service and make things right with estranged loved ones, and survive to see Teacher Quelani become a reality. Shimmer vows to keep Quelani alive.
