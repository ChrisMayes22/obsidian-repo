Session 56 saw the party leave [[The Lucky Skipper]] behind and regroup with [[Mallum]] in the city of [[Port D'Anguille]]. [[Ariana]] left the party to help Mallum cleanse the world of [[Corvigna]] influence, all as part of the [[s Dry Land in D'Anguille]] scene. Afterwards, the party split into three groups. 

[[Reina]] and [[Koyuki]] searched (mostly fruitlessly) in an attempt to find a Red Light District, Black Market, or [[Kitsune]] citizens as part of the [[s D'Anguille Prostitutes]] scene.

[[Toldrey]] and [[Armads]] visited the [[Blanchet]] manor masquerading as [[IRS]] agents in an effort to find schematics of the [[Blanchet Crypt]], al as part of the [[s IRS Ruse]] scene.

[[Shimmerlace]] and [[Quelani]] went on an [[s ice cream date]].
