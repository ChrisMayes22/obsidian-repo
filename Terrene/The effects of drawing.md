While in [[The City Terrene]], the party was attacked by doppelgängers replete with [[Corvignan Influence]]. Most of the party was together in various inns and managed to fight off their assailants, but [[Kiron]] -- who was in jail ([[Kiron in Jail]]) -- was defeated.

Kiron swallowed his doppelgänger and began to act strange and violent. The party restrained him and with the assistance of [[Mallum]] performed a complex ritual to remove the influence from him.

Later ([[s Dry Land in D'Anguille]]), Mallum hypothesized that anyone in one of [[Ariana's drawings]] was likely to suffer a similar fate.
