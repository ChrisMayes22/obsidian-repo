In this scene, [[Toldrey]] and [[Armads]] concoct fake ids and impersonate the [[IRS]] as they investigate the Blanchet family. They are **IMMEDIATELY** given service when they claim to be IRS and are handled by [[Arnold]], the buter. 

Inside the [[Blanchet]] manor, they inquire about the [[Blanchet Crypt]] and receive a peek at detailed [[Blanchet schematics]] and learn the crypt is 1000+ years old. 

The Blanchet family says they need a day to make copies of the schematics, and Toldrey agrees to return the next day.
