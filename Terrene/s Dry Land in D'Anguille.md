In this scene, the party disembarked [[The Boat]] without any attention or concern to its prior occupants. They found themselves in [[Port D'Anguille]] and -- after some shenanigans with [[a random merchant]] -- travelled to [[El Pequeno Panero]]. there, they met [[Mallum]], who had been crying on us. 

Shimmerlace and Mallum agreed to discuss [[The Reckoning War]] in private (though this never occurs). Mallum also discusses [[the "Kitsune" map]] with Koyuki and specifically does not believe that the map indicates the location of [[Kitsune]]. Mallum also discussed [[The effects of drawing]] and the [[evidence of Corvigna]] in the history of the Reckoning War. 

Mallum also discusses the history of the [[Blanchet]] family and the likelihood that the engravings in each [[gear room]] points to the location of the other [[gears]]. 

Finally, Ariana and Mallum discussed [[Homard]] and specifically the [[school at Homard]]. Mallum and Ariana then join up to try to help the local authorities in dealing with the problems emanating from [[Daurade]].
