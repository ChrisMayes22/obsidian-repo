In this scene, [[Reina]] and [[Koyuki]] search for a Black Market or Red Light District with an interest specifically in finding [[Kitsune]].  After a while, and after disguising themselves, they find [[Thieves Cant]] and street graffitti that allows them to find [[Flashy Dan's Brothel]], where they speak to Flashy Dane and Periwinkle (a gnomish prostitute). 

Unfortunately they are are not able to find any Kitsune, though Koyuki does search for them by word of mouth and by scent; Reina discusses the possibility of working prostitution.

The party learns there are multiple brothers in town, and Reina is nudged towards [[one brothel in particular]].

A book where Reina learned it is [[hard being small]] is referenced.
