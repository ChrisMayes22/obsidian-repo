The book ends on him reviewing Gogol's books and trying to connect with his dead. 

What is the author trying to say through the use of changing names, the significance of names, etc 

What you will discuss in the paragraph 


### **Through this conflict, Lahiri shows that one constructs their identity not alone but also inevitably through family, background, and culture.**

# **Gogol's Experience as a child**
----Ashime and Ashoke want him to go by Nikhil in public; he prefers Gogol. He wins out.
----Why does the child win out? Because the teacher allows him to use the name he wants. Additionally, there are complications with the birth certificate and other official documents where he is named Gogol.
----In a sense, there is then a larger conflict between American and Bengali expectations. Gogol constructs his identity in part in response to this conflict. American society does not allow him to wait for a traditional Bengali name, and it allows him to use the name he prefers because of its emphasis on his individual self-expression.


# Maxine's Reaction
----She does not see the name change as a big deal. She thinks it is really "cute."
----Although this seems accepting, it represents a way she does not fully understand his bengali culture/background
----But didn't he want to escape Bengali culture? Yes, but somehow it is still a key part of him whether he accepts it or not.
----Gogol is still part of him! 


# Dad
----Gogol is significant because he is named after an author who saved his dad's life.
----Gogol ignored the book of Gogol short stories for most of his life because he was trying to escape his name and the dad / background it represented.
----However, at the end of the novel, he rediscovers Gogol's books -- and through them something of who his dad was.
----In this way, he finds in his name a gift--the gift of his name, the gift of his father's identity/person/relationship, and the gift of his background.
----Thus identity (as represented by the name Gogol) was not built alone but received as a gift.
