Caitiff - Caitiff town or, to the kine, [[Ellington]] isn’t much of anything, just a stop off on the highway before the larger ski resorts and touristy Cedar Rapids next door.  The Caitiff like it that way.  They’ve had enough trouble to last a lifetime in the domains many of them originated in.  All things considered, it’s a pretty nice gig.  As long as anyone blowing through saves their trouble making for the resorts they couldn’t care less.
