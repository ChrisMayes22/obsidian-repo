The children of Malkav were some of the first Kindred to follow civilization into the mountains, drawn to the isolation and what it could induce in mortal minds.  When [[Camarilla]] arrived in force, Oracles were there to meet them. To this day, Malkavians occupy significant roles on both [[Anarch]] and [[Camarilla]] sides, for few know the history and secrets of the [[mountain]]s as well as they…even if their manner of revealing those secrets has at times infuriated masters of every stripe.
