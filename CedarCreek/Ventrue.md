Ventrue - The clan of kings knows the value of stability, of order.  They keep peace and in turn they are respected, even sometimes feared.  Their members busy their nights making sure every kindred in town, especially [[the visitors]] are minding their manners.  They know the [[Banu Haqim]] would like to do the same.  As long as they keep in their place the Ventrue don’t see any problems with the newcomers lending their support.
