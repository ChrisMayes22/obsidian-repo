Hecata - A jet setting family of wealthy necromancers, they know what the finer things in life are.  Too bad filth keeps finding those finer things and sullying those things with their grabby hands.  Hopefully this vacation spot doesn’t go the way of too many of the others and become nothing but a tourist trap.  It's worth investing in keeping it at least a little [[off the beaten path]].  They can afford it.
