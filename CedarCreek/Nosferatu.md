Nosferatu - These nights the sewer rats concern themselves with networking.  They know their extensive contact lists only have one thing truly on the mind.  [[Blood]].  And they know they can leverage that better than trivial gossip.  While you don’t need an invitation to visit, having one doesn’t hurt and the Nos of these nights know how to help you [[make a connection]] and get you settled.  What you do when you get here is your business.
