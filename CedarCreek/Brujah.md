Most Anarch [[Baron]]s keep a loose hold on the reins, preferring to operate less as dictators and more as the alpha in a pack of independent, wild dogs. But the Brujah Baron of Cedar Rapids has a different vision of liberty—a neo-Settite vision. A vision that recognizes in the established order a spiritual enemy, the body of [[Ra]], that can only be defeated with an equal level of organization and power. The furious and calculating power of the Serpent.

Does he believe in a literal Set? Probably not. But even so, his [[Serpent]] carries on the name and philosophy of the dark god, if not its soul. The result is that most of the baron’s chief lieutenants are not Brujah but [[Ministry]], and the loyalty they demand to the Baron’s vision leave little room for subjects with fiery tempers. Thus what Brujah survive among the [[Anarch]]s are the more philosophical of their ilk—or else cultists who share the Baron’s religious zeal. Those who can’t abide by this view must either survive as [[Autarkis]] or seek shelter under the Prince.
