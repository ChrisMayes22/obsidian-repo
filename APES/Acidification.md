Acidification occurs when soil becomes too acidic. Sometimes this can happen naturally from acidic [[Parent Material]], but it can also come from basic compounds being removed through [[leaching]], from deposits from [[acid rain]], and from [[monocrops]] depleting the soil of bases or depositing acids.

Acids harm crops directly when they are absorbed by plants (toxic) or when they indirectly make toxic metals like Aluminum easier to absorb. Acidification can be fixed by adding [[limestone]] to the affected soil.
